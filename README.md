# MASA-Serial
<p align="justify">
The <b>MASA-Serial extension</b> is used with the <a href="https://github.com/edanssandes/MASA-Core">MASA architecture</a> to align DNA sequences of unrestricted size with the Smith-Waterman algorithm combined with Myers-Miller. 
This is a simple template that can be used as baseline of other extensions.
